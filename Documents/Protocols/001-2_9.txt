## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)


Outcomes:
* The group discussed different project ideas. Among the ideas were an email application, a work schedule application, some kind of game and a paint-like application. 
* The group decided to work on the email application, since it should be a fairly intuitive application and Martin has even looked up some useful APIs.
* We plan on using at least the following APIs:
   * JavaFX 
   * Possibly https://www.simplejavamail.org/ (sending email)
   * https://javaee.github.io/javamail/#API_Documentation (receiving email, and possibly also for sending)


Assignments:
* The group will together for now:
   * Write user stories.
   * Sketch on a GUI.
* The group members will both together and individually:
   * Read up on the APIs.
